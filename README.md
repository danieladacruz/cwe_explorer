## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cwe-dependency-graph.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url

### CWE Table
- `id`: string (Primary Key)
- `name`: string

### CWE Relations Table
- `id`: number (Primary Key)
- `cwe_id`: string (Foreign Key)
- `related_cwe`: string (Foreign Key)
- `relation_type`: string
